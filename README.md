## Configuring Email Sending

To configure email sending with your own SMTP server, follow these steps:

1. Open the `process_form.php` file in your code editor.

2. Find the `// Server settings` section in the file.

3. Modify the following lines by replacing the values with your own SMTP server details:
   
   ```php
   // Server settings
   //$mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_SERVER;                      //Enable verbose debug output
   $mail->isSMTP();
   $mail->Host = 'smtp.office365.com';  // Replace with appropriate SMTP server
   $mail->SMTPAuth = true;
   $mail->Username = 'your_email_address@example.com';  // Replace with your email address
   $mail->Password = 'your_password';  // Replace with your password
   $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS;
   $mail->Port = 587;
